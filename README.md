# Text Analysis in R for Media and Communication

An interactive Quarto book covering computational text analysis for media and communication researchers. Interactive code examples run directly in the browser via [quarto-live](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/) (WebAssembly — no server required).

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Minimum version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| R | 4.3 | [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/) |
| Quarto | 1.4 | [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) |
| renv | 1.0 | `install.packages("renv")` in R |

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install the quarto-live extension

```sh
quarto add r-wasm/quarto-live
```

This downloads the extension into `_extensions/r-wasm/live/`. The `_extensions/` directory should be committed to version control so collaborators do not need to re-run this step.

### 3. Install R packages

Open R in the project directory (or open the project in RStudio). renv activates automatically via `.Rprofile`.

**To render the book** (production dependencies only — matches CI):

```r
renv::restore()
```

This installs the exact package versions pinned in `renv.lock` into the project-local library (`renv/library/`). It does not affect your system-wide R packages.

**To develop the book** (production + development dependencies, e.g. `languageserver` for VS Code):

```r
renv::install()
```

This reads [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION) and installs everything under `Imports` *and* `Suggests`.

> **First time on a machine?** If renv itself is not yet installed, run `install.packages("renv")` first.

## Rendering the book

### Preview locally (live reload)

```sh
quarto preview
```

Opens the book in your browser and rebuilds changed chapters automatically.

### Full render

```sh
quarto render
```

Output goes to `_book/`. Open `_book/index.html` in any browser.

### Render a single chapter

```sh
quarto render chapters/06-sentiment.qmd
```

### Freeze behaviour

`_quarto.yml` sets `execute: freeze: auto`. Quarto caches chunk output in `_freeze/` and only re-executes a chapter when its source changes. Commit `_freeze/` to version control so collaborators get pre-computed output without re-running all code.

## Package management

This project uses [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) with [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION) as the declarative source of truth — analogous to `pyproject.toml` with uv.

### Two kinds of dependencies

Both are declared in [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION):

- **`Imports:`** — *production* dependencies. Packages used by the book itself (e.g. `tidyverse`). These go into `renv.lock` and are installed by CI when rendering the book.
- **`Suggests:`** — *development* dependencies. Tooling that is useful while authoring but not needed to render (e.g. `languageserver` for VS Code / LSP support). These are **not** written to `renv.lock` and are not installed in CI.

### How this is configured

Two settings in [`renv/settings.json`](renv/settings.json) make DESCRIPTION the single source of truth:

- **`snapshot.type: "explicit"`** — `renv::snapshot()` only records packages listed in `DESCRIPTION` (plus their transitive production deps). Packages installed locally for experimentation never sneak into `renv.lock`. Without this setting, renv's default behavior is to scan every `.R`/`.qmd` file for `library()` calls and record whatever it finds, which makes the lockfile responsive to any experimental code still in the working tree.
- **`snapshot.dev: false`** — `renv::snapshot()` ignores the `Suggests` field. This is what keeps development tooling out of `renv.lock` even when it's installed in the local library.

Together these mean: what ends up in `renv.lock` is exactly the closure of `DESCRIPTION`'s `Imports` field, nothing more.

### Adding a new package

1. Add the package to [`DESCRIPTION`](DESCRIPTION):
   - Under `Imports:` if it's used in the book itself.
   - Under `Suggests:` if it's only needed for development (editor tooling, linters, etc.).
   - Optionally, add a minimum-version constraint when the book relies on a specific API, e.g. `quanteda (>= 4.0)`.
2. Install it locally:
   ```r
   renv::install()
   ```
3. Refresh the lockfile:
   ```r
   renv::snapshot()
   ```
   This updates `renv.lock` for production packages. Dev-only packages (under `Suggests`) are deliberately not written to the lockfile, so this is a no-op for them.

### Updating packages

Package versions are pinned in `renv.lock` and never upgrade automatically — CI always installs the exact versions recorded there, and `renv::install()` is a no-op for packages that are already present. Version bumps only happen when someone deliberately updates them.

A periodic update review (e.g. quarterly, or when a major release lands for a package the book relies on heavily) looks like this:

1. See what's out of date:
   ```r
   renv::status()
   old.packages(lib.loc = renv::paths$library())
   ```
2. Pull updates into the library:
   ```r
   renv::update()              # all packages
   # or: renv::update("quanteda")   # one package
   ```
3. Re-render the book to check nothing broke:
   ```sh
   quarto render
   ```
4. If the render succeeded, commit the bumped lockfile:
   ```r
   renv::snapshot()
   ```
   Then `git add renv.lock && git commit`. The PR diff shows exactly which versions moved.
5. If something broke, roll back without commiting:
   ```r
   renv::restore()             # re-installs the previous pinned versions
   ```

### Everyday commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install production deps only (matches CI) | `renv::restore()` |
| Install production + development deps | `renv::install()` |
| Record current production versions to `renv.lock` | `renv::snapshot()` |
| Check for drift between library and lockfile | `renv::status()` |
| Update a package to its latest version | `renv::update("pkg")` then `renv::snapshot()` |

### What is and is not committed

```
committed:
  DESCRIPTION        # declared dependencies (Imports = prod, Suggests = dev)
  renv.lock          # pinned versions of production deps only
  renv/settings.json # renv configuration (snapshot.dev: false)
  renv/activate.R    # renv bootstrapper
  .Rprofile          # activates renv on project open

not committed (in .gitignore):
  renv/library/      # installed binaries — rebuilt per machine/OS
  renv/staging/
```

## Contributing

1. Create a branch, make changes, run `quarto render` to check output.
2. If you added packages, follow the steps under [Adding a new package](#adding-a-new-package) and commit the resulting changes to `DESCRIPTION` (and `renv.lock` if it changed).
3. If you added chapters, update the `chapters:` list in `_quarto.yml`.
4. Open a pull request.

## Using VS Code for webr

The official Quarto VS Code extension does not treat `{webr}` code blocks as R, so out of the box you get neither syntax highlighting nor the usual "run this line" shortcut inside them. Two small tweaks restore both.

### Syntax highlighting for `{webr}` blocks

The Quarto extension's TextMate grammar only matches `{r}`, `{R}`, `{Rprofile}`, and identifiers ending in `-r` — `{webr}` falls through. Upstream issue: [quarto-dev/quarto#820](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto/issues/820).

Edit the installed grammar file at `~/.vscode/extensions/quarto.quarto-<version>/syntaxes/quarto.tmLanguage` and add `|webr` to the alternation inside the `fenced_code_block_r` begin pattern:

```diff
- (R|r|s|S|Rprofile|\{\.r.+?\}|.+\-r)
+ (R|r|s|S|Rprofile|\{\.r.+?\}|.+\-r|webr)
```

Reload the window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Developer: Reload Window"). Caveat: the extension replaces this file on update, so the edit must be re-applied after upgrading the Quarto extension.

### `Ctrl+Enter` to run the current line or selection

`quarto.runSelection` refuses to run `{webr}` cells because `webr` isn't in its list of executable languages. Bind `Ctrl+Enter` directly to the R extension's `r.runSelection`, which sends the current line (or selection) to the R terminal regardless of the surrounding cell type.

Open `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)" and add:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+enter",
  "command": "r.runSelection",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == quarto && !findInputFocussed && !replaceInputFocussed"
},
{
  "key": "ctrl+enter",
  "command": "-quarto.runCurrent",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == quarto && !findInputFocussed && !replaceInputFocussed"
}
```

Requires the [R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r) (`REditorSupport.r`). The code runs in your **local** R session — the in-browser webR runtime only exists in the rendered HTML.
